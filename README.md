# Amusement Park Simulator
This was a group project, build for programming course at Metropolia UAS. Programming course was part of my second year studies and was made in three weeks. Code and simulator's user interface language is Finnish.

The aim of the project was to make a simulator of a small amusement park. The simulator is used to study the effects of the weather on the amusement park's attractions, the number of visitors, and the amount of the amusement park's income. Users can easily change the values of the system's components and distribution parameters. The amusement park includes an entrance, a grill, and five amusement park attractions.

The project was built using MVC architecture. The user interface was done with JavaFX and styling with CSS. The simulator is using SQL relational database and ORM was handled with Hibernate. JUnit5 was used for the unit testing.
